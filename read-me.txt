Parallax Shadow version 1.0

To add the parallax effect to an element, simple add a class of "parallaxShadow". You may view a working demo of the program on codepen (http://codepen.io/www139/pen/wWBdWK).

This release has no mobile support since the mouse coordinates are not mobile compatible. If I have time, I will release a version with using touch move for compatibility with mobile devices.

All major desktop browsers should be supported although I have done no thorough testing. However, the script appears to only utilize features that are well supported.
